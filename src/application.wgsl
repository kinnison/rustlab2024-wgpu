Tasks:
1. Bring colors to the screen by editing your fragment shader.
2. Change the vertices of our two triangles so they cover the whole screen.
3. Experiment with different colors based on the coordinates of a pixel.
   You can, for example, create gradients by dividing the pixel's position
   by the width/height of our surface. Unfortunately, we can't dynamically
   access the width and height from our shaders yet, so you must use hardcoded
   values, e.g.:
     let width = 1280.0;
     let height = 720.0;

   You could also try plotting a function, by comparing the Y-coordinate against
   the value of some f(x). Beware floating point accuracy, you will need some tolerance
   in your comparisons.
   The distance of your Y towards the real result could also be visualized by adjusting
   the intensity of your returned color (the lower the components, the darker the color).

If you have semantic or syntactical errors in your shader, the application will crash on launch.
Scroll past the panic's stack trace to see the actual errors.
