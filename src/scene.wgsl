    // Our camera's viewport has its own coordinate system, which we define as a range

    // 1. Translate the screen pixel coordinates (x, y) to viewport coordinates (u, v).
    // Remember that (0, 0) is the center of our viewport.
    // To translate the coordinates, you first must compute the relative position of the
    // pixel on the screen (by dividing it by the frame's width / height).
    // Then, you multiply it with the viewport's width / height to get the relative position
    // on the viewport.
    // Because the viewport's coordinates are not relative to one of the edges but to its center,
    // you must also subtract half of the viewport's width / height.
    // let u = ...
    // let v = ...

    // 2. Now we can finally compute the direction of our ray. All rays begin at the camera's
    // origin and then go through the desired pixel's position on the viewport.
    // The focal length is the distance between our camera's origin and the viewport.
    // Our view direction always points at the center (0, 0) of the viewport.
    // Multipliying the focal length with the view direction gives us the viewport's center point
    // in coordinates relative to the camera's origin.
    // We can then offset this relative coordinate to point to the desired pixel on the viewport
    // instead.
    // To do this, add the viewport coordinate u multiplied by the viewport's right pointing
    // horizontal direction (to translate the offset into scene coordinates), and the viewport
    // coordinate v multiplied by the viewport's upwards pointing vertical direction.
